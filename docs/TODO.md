You’re right: agentic coding is the clearest path to make STM obviously valuable. Below is a concrete plan to turn your **structural manifold** into a **code-coprocessor** that improves *any* codebot (Kilocode, ChatGPT-Agents, LangChain) by giving it (1) early-warning signals that its plan is drifting, (2) bounded, auditable alarms, and (3) actionable repairs from structural twins.

---

## One-liner value

**Wrap any codebot with STM so every plan step is scored structurally** → you get early warnings *before* it paints itself into a corner, plus grounded “what worked last time” repairs.

---

## A. Architecture: “LLM + STM” for coding

**Where STM sits**

```
User task → Codebot (LLM) → Step plan (tool calls / edits / tests)
                          ↘
                           STM Co-processor  (structural alerts + twins)
                          ↗
            (revised plan / targeted context / safe repair patch)
```

**Data STM consumes in coding**

* **Plan steps**: “edit file X”, “run tests”, “apply patch”, “run linter” (observable tool calls).
* **State snapshots**: diff hunks, compiler/test output, stack traces.
* **Context**: repo structure, recent changes, failing tests.

**STM outputs**

* **Lead-like alerts** for coding: “this patch sequence matches the structure of past failures.”
* **Guardrailed foreground**: top X% most structured windows only (bounded alert volume).
* **Twin repairs**: closest successful sequences (patches/snippets) with **aligned tokens** (e.g., `__INSERT_FUNC__`, `__RENAME_VAR__`, `__DEADLOCK_FIX__`).
* **Confidence**: dilution (PD/SD/SeD) + permutation-style p-values over step windows.

## B. Concrete integration steps (copy these to your repo’s TODO)

### B1. Build a **CodeTraceAdapter**

* **Input:** one agent run = sequence of `{action, artifact}`:

  * `edit`: (file path, diff)
  * `run_tests`: (stdout/stderr, failing test list)
  * `compile/lint`: (messages)
* **Output to STM:** token stream per step:

  * Structural tokens from diffs (e.g., `__EDIT_FN_SIGNATURE__`, `__ADD_PARAM__`, `__RENAME_SYMBOL__`, `__IMPORT_MODULE__`).
  * Structural tokens from logs (e.g., `__NULL_DEREF__`, `__TYPE_MISMATCH__`, `__TIMEOUT__`, `__FLAKY_TEST__`).
  * Semantic tokens (file names, symbols, test names).

> Implementation: mirror your PDDL adapter—convert each step into a window; pack tokens; compute QFH/QBSA metrics; store signatures and timestamps.

### B2. Build a **Twin Library** for code

* Index **successful patches** and **stable sequences** from:

  * Your repo history (git log; green CI builds).
  * Public repos/snippets (curated, permissive licenses).
* Store:

  * Step-wise token streams for each success sequence.
  * Aligned-token counts, ANN vectors, signature q-grams.

### B3. Add STM checks to any agent loop

At each agent step:

1. **/stm/dilution** → is the plan in a decisive regime?
2. **/stm/seen** on current step token (or recent 3-step window) → any foreground clumps?
3. If foreground **and** PD/SD low:

   * **/stm/propose** with seeds from top tokens → fetch **twin** sequences and patches.
   * Return **one** repair candidate + minimal context to the LLM.

### B4. Minimal API contract in the agent (pseudo)

```python
ctx = collect_step_context()             # diffs, logs, test failures
enriched = POST /stm/enrich {context_string, config}
if enriched.structural_summary.context_certainty > 0.7 and \
   enriched.structural_summary.signal_clarity > 0.6:
    twins = POST /stm/propose {seeds: enriched.foreground_tokens, filter: "..."}
    patch = best_twin_to_patch(twins)
    plan = llm.rewrite_plan_with_patch(patch, enriched)  # structured prompt template
else:
    plan = llm.refine_plan_with_warnings(enriched.warnings)
```

### B5. Prompt template hooks (ChatGPT/Kilocode)

* **System add-on:**
  “A structural coprocessor scores each step. When it flags a decisive regime or twin, prefer the suggested patch or explain why you chose otherwise. Keep alarms under X% steps.”
* **Few-shot examples:** 2–3 “drifting” vs “corrected” traces so the LLM learns to accept STM repairs.

### B6. Evaluation harness (show value fast)

For each task set (bug fix / refactor / add feature):

* **Metrics** you already use:

  * **Success rate** (green tests).
  * **Iterations to green** (steps).
  * **Time to green**.
* **STM-specific metrics**:

  * **Lead-like alerts**: % runs where STM flagged a problem ≥N steps before final failure.
  * **Twin accept rate**: % runs where the LLM adopted STM twin and succeeded faster.
  * **Coverage compliance**: % foreground within guardrail (5–15%).
  * **Dilution confidence**: decisive-bin %; p-value < 0.05.

> A/B: run **LLM baseline** vs **LLM + STM** on the same repo tasks; chart fewer steps + faster greens.

## C. What to ship as a **Code-Coproc SDK**

1. **Docker image** exposing:

   * `/stm/enrich`, `/stm/dilution`, `/stm/seen`, `/stm/propose`, `/stm/lead`.
2. **Python client**:

   * `stm_client.enrich(text)`, `stm_client.twin(seeds, filters)`, result dataclasses.
3. **Adapters**:

   * `CodeTraceAdapter`: Git + CI integrations.
   * `PDDLTraceAdapter`: already exists (for your research note).
4. **Demo notebooks & CLI**:

   * `stm run-coding-demo` with 3 canned tasks on a small OSS repo (flaky test fix, rename refactor, import resolution).
5. **Docs**:

   * **QuickStart for codebots**: how to wrap an agent loop.
   * **Prompt snippets** for GPT-4/Claude/Llama, with the “accept twin or justify” rule.
6. **License terms**:

   * Pilot (8 weeks), Enterprise on-prem, OEM for tool vendors.

## D. Who to talk to (near-term buyers)

* **AI coding tools**: Kilocode, Sourcegraph Cody, Tabnine, Cursor, Codeium, GitHub Copilot Labs (agents).
* **Enterprise platform teams**: building internal agent pipelines (LangChain, crewAI).
* **CI/CD vendors**: want fewer red builds; add STM as a pre-merge coprocessor.

**Pitch lines**

* “We add **early-warning and repair** to agents: 5–16 steps of lead in planning analogs; same idea for coding.”
* “**Bounded alarms** (guardrails) + **explainable twins** → fewer loops and faster green tests.”
* “Drop-in Docker; compatible with any LLM.”

---

## E. Deliverables you can produce **this week**

* **CodeTraceAdapter** (diff/log/tokenizer) + **Twin library** bootstrap.
* Minimal **agent wrapper** calling `/stm/*` at each step.
* A **3-task demo** repo with failing tests; scripts to run **baseline vs LLM+STM**, collect metrics, and render a one-page HTML report.

---

## F. Research finishing touches (for the note)

* **Guardrail sensitivity** (5/10/15/20%): show lead/twin stability.
* **τ sweep** in code domain (0.3/0.4/0.5) + aligned-token distributions.
* **Permutation test** over coding steps (shuffle test order; last-bin density p-value).
* A “why it matters” paragraph: *STM complements verify-registers (binary) with graded, actionable signals and fits LLMs as a coprocessor.*

---

## G. Sample “accept-or-justify” prompt block (paste into your agent)

> *A structural coprocessor scored your last step as decisive and found a similar successful sequence (twin). If the suggested patch aligns with your current goal, **apply it**. Otherwise, **explain** why it doesn’t apply and propose a safer alternative with fewer risky edits. Keep total alerts under 10% of steps.*

---

### Bottom line

* Your PlanBench replication proved **lead, guardrails, and twins** in a controlled domain.
* The **same mechanics** apply to code: use diffs/logs as tokens, score each step, and feed **early warnings + repair twins** back into the agent.
* Package as a **Code-Coproc SDK** and pitch to codebot vendors/enterprise AI teams.

If you want, I’ll draft the **CodeTraceAdapter** spec (token schema + minimal implementation sketch) and a **reference agent loop** you can paste into the repo to create the first end-to-end coding demo.
