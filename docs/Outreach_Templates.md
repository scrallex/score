Subject: Early-warning structure in your telemetry

Hi <Name> — we’ve built a portable “structural manifold” that finds twins and pre-onset windows in noisy telemetry.
On NASA MMS we surfaced 3 cross-day twins (each 50 aligned windows, ANN ≈ 2e-3) and a rising foreground density in the
last five minutes (7.4%), all with a 5–7% guardrail.

We can run a 4–8 week pilot on your logs (CSV/HDF5) and deliver a scorecard (coverage, twins, mean ANN, lead-time vs quiet),
plus an optional live `/stm/seen` demo. Happy to share a one-pager and set up a 10-minute walkthrough—interested?

Thanks,
<You>

## LinkedIn DM
We built a structure-first engine that spots cross-day “twins” and pre-onset ramps in noisy telemetry.
NASA MMS results: 3 twins (50 aligned windows, ANN ≈ 2e-3) and a 7.4% last-5-min density with a 5–7% guardrail.
Interested in a 10-minute `/stm/seen` demo + pilot plan?

- “We turn raw telemetry into rhythm fingerprints that show structural twins and early-warning windows.”
- “MMS proved it: 3 cross-day twins (50 aligned windows, ANN ≈ 2e-3) and a rising last-5-min density to 7.4%, with a guardrailed 5–7% foreground.”
- “It’s portable: adapters, batch reports in weeks, live `/stm/seen` in days, fully reproducible.”
- “Let’s run a 4–8 week pilot on your data and deliver the same scorecard.”
