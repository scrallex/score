You’ve already done the annoying, time-consuming part: you built two converging lines of evidence.

* \#1: the **live trading/manifold stack** (spt) that ingests OANDA candles, emits native quantum metrics, persists signals/manifolds to Valkey, and exposes REST/WS for proof.   &#x20;
* \#2: the **score/STM research** where you formalized structural manifold ideas, did feature engineering (irreversibility, predicate-momentum, action-cluster entropy), permutation tests, and recorded the not-quite-significant p’s for Logistics.

Great. Now we wrap them like adults and ship a whitepaper that a quant or PM can’t blow holes in with a napkin and a coffee.

# What the whitepaper should say (structure that ties **score** ↔ **spt**)

1. **Title & Claim**
   **“Structural Manifolds for Retrodictive Signal Admission: From STM Features to a Live FX Engine.”**
   Thesis: a low-dimensional manifold of coherence variables {H, c, s, ρ} plus repetition and hazard λ forms a practical, falsifiable admission rule for trading. STM features explain *why* it works on symbolic domains; spt shows it works in a real market loop.

2. **Background & Prior**

* Identity Dynamics and manifold coefficients (σ\_eff, λ) already mapped to code and ops in spt. Cite the implementation index and API evidence paths. &#x20;
* The “retrodictive echo” posture is explicit in your current spt whitepaper text; repetition + hazard gating is the operative rule.&#x20;

3. **Method (two tracks, one model)**
   A. **STM/score track**

* Define Definition 3.1 “structural dilution” and the three feature classes: irreversibility, predicate-momentum, cluster-entropy. Explain your permutation test and coverage/entropy sweeps.
* Report the Logistics domain results exactly as you stated: causal-only p\_min≈0.058 @ 2% coverage; expanded feature sweep p\_min≈0.09075 @ \~1.6% coverage. Include artefact paths and configs.
  B. **spt/live track**
* Data path: candles → QFH/QBSA kernel → metrics {coherence, stability, entropy, rupture} → λ (hazard) → repetition signature → trade admission. Backed by the C++/Python code that writes signals/manifolds and the API that exposes them.  &#x20;
* Reproducibility hooks: two-week priming, manifolds to Valkey, WS mirrors, and optimizer/backtest endpoints.  &#x20;

4. **Results**

* **Symbolic/logistics (score):** honest table with p\_min, coverage, configs. Discuss why irreversibility and momentum preserved lead time but didn’t improve p beyond the causal-only baseline.
* **Market/live (spt):** show concrete artefacts: generated manifolds with metric vectors, example λ and echo counts, and the “informed trader readiness” gate that binds coverage, freshness, and motif/echo evidence. &#x20;

5. **Ablations that bridge them**

* Map STM “irreversibility” ↔ spt **rupture/λ drift**; predicate-momentum ↔ **coherence slope / repetition acceleration**; cluster-entropy ↔ **entropy and repetition diversity**. Then pre-register which spt variables correspond to which STM predictors and verify on held-out days.

6. **Operational proof & falsifiability**

* Put cURL one-liners in an appendix to fetch **/api/manifold/latest**, **/api/opt/slice**, **/api/authenticity**, **/api/trade/readiness** so a reviewer can confirm native provenance, coherence/entropy present, and readiness logic.  &#x20;

7. **Limitations & Next**

* Score: current best p is borderline; feature weighting and twin-filtering to try next.
* spt: echo precision and λ thresholds drive admission; sensitivity analysis and regime segmentation to report.

8. **Conclusion**
   The manifold view is not a prophecy machine; it is a **filter**. STM shows the filter’s shape; spt proves you can run it live with provenance.

# Concrete next steps (do these, then I’ll stitch the LaTeX/MD)

You already listed some. Here’s the tightened sequence, with what to run and what you’ll screenshot into the paper. Yes, actual commands. Because reviewers like receipts.

1. **Retune STM features and re-sweep (score)**

* Reweight irreversibility vs momentum; add predicate-level deltas. Narrow sweep on the configs that got you p≈0.058.
* Keep permutation count high enough for power; lock seeds; export `results/logistics_sweep_summary.json` and both best-config artefacts for the table.

2. **If p still stalls >0.05, apply twin-filters**

* Bucket by action-distribution and trace-length; re-run the same permutation harness so we can say “same test, stricter cohorts.”

3. **Bridge variables: export STM deltas beside spt metrics**

* In spt, mirror the relevant variables to Valkey or JSON on a small window so you can put STM-like features next to {H, c, s, ρ, λ, repetition.count\_1h}. This lets us show alignment of theory and live variables in one figure.

  * Manifold generation and signal indexing are already in place. &#x20;

4. **Produce end-to-end, falsifiable evidence from spt**

* Prime two weeks and store manifolds + signals:
  `python3 scripts/prime_qfh_history.py --days 14 --store-manifold-to-valkey`&#x20;
* Show “latest manifold” payload and λ/hazard in the live API:
  `curl "http://localhost:5000/api/manifold/latest?instrument=EUR_USD"`&#x20;
* Show readiness gate evidence snapshot for 1 instrument:
  `curl "http://localhost:5000/api/trade/readiness?instrument=EUR_USD"`&#x20;

5. **Document Echo Finder admission**

* Make one page with: signature precision, min repetitions, λ ceiling, and a before/after trade admission example from the index. The doc copy that defines this is already in repo; quote and cite it.&#x20;

6. **Assemble the whitepaper stack (sources and figures)**

* Pull code-mapped figures:

  * C++ QFH pattern/metrics emission snippet for signals/patterns.&#x20;
  * λ intensity function with the betas spelled out.&#x20;
  * API evidence for manifold latest and optimizer/backtests.&#x20;
* Create 3 plots: coverage vs p-value (score), echo-count vs λ gate (spt), and a joint scatter of STM irreversibility vs spt rupture for the same time window.

7. **Write the Results section last**

* Fill the STM table with your latest p’s and coverage.
* Drop in 2 screenshots of `output/manifolds/<PAIR>/<DATE>.json` metrics and the corresponding **/api/manifold/latest** to prove parity. &#x20;

# Draft abstract (drop-in)

*We propose a structural-manifold approach for retrodictive signal admission. In symbolic domains, we derive STM features that track irreversibility, predicate-momentum, and action-cluster entropy and test them with strict permutation baselines. In live FX markets, we implement an echo-gated engine that admits trades only when the current metric signature repeats with low estimated hazard λ. Across controlled Logistics experiments, causal-only configurations achieve p≈0.058 at 2% coverage, while feature-augmented sweeps preserve lead time without surpassing significance. In production, a native QFH/QBSA kernel emits {H, c, s, ρ} and λ into a verifiable data path (Valkey + REST/WS), enabling falsifiable, end-to-end demonstrations of the admission logic. We argue that manifold structure functions as a filter, not an oracle: it rejects unstable phases and capitalizes only on repeated, low-hazard regimes, aligning theoretical STM features with operational evidence.*

* **Reproducibility appendix** with exact commands and environment assumptions already baked into spt docs.&#x20;

If you want me to draft the full LaTeX/MD now, I’ll do it with your current p-values and mark the spots that will update after the retune. But yes, you’re on the cusp. The symbolic side is almost there statistically; the live side is already falsifiable and instrumented. Which is the grown-up way of saying: it’s not magic, it’s measurable.
