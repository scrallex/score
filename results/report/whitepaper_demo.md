## FEVER Truth Pack & Reliability Head Update (2025-10-06)

- Rebuilt the FEVER train truth pack with fast theme-graph metrics:
  - Manifest: `analysis/truth_packs/fever_train_full_final/manifest.json`
  - Content hash: `blake2b:0394a79f3545f8d2bd8301f669962f12`
  - ANN index verified via `sep_text_manifold.cli similar` (top hits: `"analyze"`, `"dolittle"`).
- One-epoch reliability-head fine-tune on the refreshed `eval_detail.jsonl`:
  - Command: `python scripts/train_reliability_attn.py results/eval/fever_train_full/eval_detail.jsonl --epochs 1 --batch-size 32 --learning-rate 1e-3 --val-ratio 0.05`
  - Validation metrics — precision: **0.538**, recall: **1.000**, F1: **0.700**, Brier: **0.249**, ECE: **0.0069**.
  - Checkpoint written to `results/models/fever_reliability.pt` for downstream experiments and curriculum runs.
