Subject: Structural early-warning on PlanBench (lead-time + twins beyond pass/fail)

Hi <Name>,

Thanks again for sharing the PlanBench replication details last month. I reran all three domains (100 instances each) and layered the Structural Manifold (STM) on top of the standard VAL traces. The result is a drop-in early-warning signal: we see foreground alerts 5–16 steps before failure, a bounded guardrail (10–20%), and actionable “twin” repairs that line up token-for-token with the successful runs.

I’m attaching the scorecard, dilution plots, and τ-sweep summary. Everything is reproducible from the repo—`make planbench-all` still drives the pipeline, and the new appendix in `MMS_Structural_Precursors_v0.1.md` explains the guardrail variants.

Attachments:

- docs/note/fig_tau_sweep_planbench.png
- docs/note/appendix_guardrail_sensitivity.csv

Would you be open to a 20-minute call next week to walk through the findings or compare notes async if that’s easier? Happy to send a calendar invite or keep it over email.

Best,
<Your Name>
