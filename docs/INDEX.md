# Documentation Index

## Guardrail Demo
- `docs/note/semantic_guardrail_storyboard.md` – narrative arc and demo flow, including core discovery and operational checklist.
- `docs/note/semantic_guardrail_runbook.md` – commands for ingesting manifolds and replaying the stream.
- `docs/note/reality_filter_demo.md` – step-by-step operator runbook for the reality filter demo.
- `results/semantic_guardrail_metrics.json` – generated telemetry (hallucination rate, repair yield, citations, latency).
- `scripts/reality_filter_pack.py` – turn any truth-pack into manifold/index/semantic artefacts.
- `scripts/reality_filter_stream.py` – produce span-level stream with twin repairs and KPIs from the pack manifest.
- `scripts/reality_filter_service.py` – FastAPI `/seen` shim for runtime span checks.

## Hallucination Control
- `docs/note/semantic_coherence_hallucination_framework.md` – technical blueprint for using STM coherence as a hallucination gate.
- `docs/task.md` – top-level plan for positioning and presenting the semantic guardrail.
- `docs/whitepaper/reality_filter_methods.md` – methods note draft.

## Trading Heritage
- `docs/whitepaper/reliability_gated_recurrence_polished.pdf` – live trading gate built on recurrence + hazard.
- `docs/whitepaper/QFH_Manifold_Foundation.pdf` – structural metric definitions across markets and planning traces.
- `docs/whitepaper/STM_Structural_Manifold_Whitepaper.pdf` – background on STM guardrails and live instrumentation.

## API & Utilities
- `scripts/semantic_guardrail_stream.py` – generates the annotated stream (twins, repairs, metrics).
- `scripts/reality_filter_stream.py` – span-level wrapper that drives the dashboard via truth-pack manifolds.
- `scripts/demos/semantic_guardrail_dashboard.py` – three-panel dashboard with live KPIs.
- `scripts/semantic_bridge_demo.py` / `scripts/semantic_bridge_plot.py` – semantic projections feeding the scatter.
- `scripts/reality_filter_pack.py` – truth-pack ingestion + manifest builder for reality filter deployments.

## Figures & Outputs
- `results/semantic_bridge_combined.png` – hybrid scatter background (docs + telemetry).
- `results/semantic_guardrail_stream.jsonl` – latest replay of the guardrail stream (regenerated by the demo target).
