### May 2025 Update

- [x] Strengthened domain-specific feature extraction: PDDL transitions now
  emit effect-alignment tokens and CodeTrace diffs feed AST-aware edit
  descriptors into the manifold.
- [x] Added permutation-aware calibration (`--optimize-permutation`) and
  dynamic fallback logic so guardrails prefer statistically significant
  coverage before dropping to secondary targets.

### Ways to Improve the STM Whitepaper and Technology

Based on a full review of the "Structural Manifold Guardrails for Symbolic Planning Agents" whitepaper (11 pages total), I'll outline targeted improvements. This draws directly from the paper's self-identified limitations (Section 7.1), future work suggestions (Section 7.2), results analysis (Section 5, including high p-values and ablations), and general research best practices for AI guardrail systems. The paper is already strong in reproducibility (open-source scripts, detailed protocols) and rigor (e.g., 20,000-iteration permutation tests), but it highlights its own gaps in statistical significance and scalability. I'll separate suggestions into **technical improvements** (for STM itself) and **paper/presentation improvements** (for clarity, impact, and funding appeal). These build on the paper's core strengths: 5% calibrated coverage, perfect twin recall (100%), multi-step lead times (5-16 steps), and ~35% uplift in CodeTrace tasks.

#### Technical Improvements to STM
The paper's results show solid performance in controlled settings (e.g., p<0.05 in Logistics at 2.5% coverage with 10-step lead), but high p-values in Blocksworld (min 0.62) and Mystery Blocksworld (min 0.14) indicate alerts are often not significantly better than random. Permutation tests (Table 4) and ablations (Table 3) reveal fragility—e.g., wider windows (768 bytes) boost lead time but raise p_min to 0.12-1.00. Focus on enhancing discriminative power without sacrificing precision (which is already 1.0).

1. **Strengthen Discriminative Signals and Features**:
   - **Why?** Current dilution signals (coherence as graph density, entropy as token dispersion, stability as temporal similarity) work well for Logistics but fail to separate signals from noise in simpler domains like Blocksworld. The paper notes (Section 5.3) that "improving discriminative power requires stronger foreground features rather than stricter timing alone."
   - **How to Improve**:
     - Add domain-specific features: E.g., incorporate PDDL-specific metrics like precondition-effect mismatches or invariant violations (tying closer to [3]'s chain-of-thought). For coding (CodeTrace), add syntax-aware signals (e.g., AST density via Python's ast module).
     - Experiment with hybrid signals: Combine with embeddings from tuned LLMs (e.g., Llama-3 from [3]) for semantic coherence, or use graph neural nets on the manifold to capture higher-order relationships.
     - Test: Run ablations with new features on scaled datasets (as in Table 3's n=500 probe), aiming for p_min <0.05 across all domains. Integrate into calibration loop (scripts/calibrate_router.py) to optimize features in-loop, not post-hoc.

2. **Scale and Diversify Datasets/Twins**:
   - **Why?** Limited scale (300 problems/domain, 3 CodeTrace tasks) and synthetic twins reduce generalizability. Table 3 shows n=500 helps Logistics (p_min=0.035 at 2.9% coverage) but not Blocksworld/Mystery. Real-world data would enrich twins, improving recall in diverse scenarios.
   - **How to Improve**:
     - Expand to 500-1,000 instances/domain as suggested (Section 7.2), using real-world sources: Robotics telemetry (e.g., ROS logs), bug-fix commits (GitHub repos), or supply chain traces (e.g., SAP simulations).
     - Enrich twins: Use the PLANBENCH_EXTRA_TWINS hook to merge multi-domain data. Add filters like "signature-locked" (mentioned in ablations) or q-gram thresholds >2 for tighter alignment.
     - Test: Re-run permutation tests (scripts/run_permutation_guardrail.py) on enriched corpora; target p_mean <0.8 and CI95 narrowing to [0.6, 0.8] or better.

3. **Enhance Dynamic Calibration and Significance**:
   - **Why?** The dynamic drop to 2.5% for Logistics (p_min=0.035) is a win, but it's domain-specific. High aggregate p_min (0.10) limits claims of "statistically meaningful lead times" (Section 4.3).
   - **How to Improve**:
     - Extend in-loop permutation testing to all domains during calibration, optimizing for p≤0.05 while balancing coverage/lead (e.g., via multi-objective optimization in calibrate_router.py).
     - Add adaptive thresholds: Use runtime feedback (e.g., from VAL in [3]) to adjust percentiles based on trace length or complexity.
     - Test: Increase shuffles to 50,000 for finer p-distributions; ablate on window sizes (256-768 bytes) with enriched twins to find sweet spots (e.g., 10-12 step lead with p_min<0.05).

4. **Expand Cross-Domain Applicability and Integration**:
   - **Why?** STM excels in PDDL/CodeTrace but adapters are limited (Section 7.1). Comparison to PDDL-INSTRUCT (Section 6) is high-level; deeper hybrid could yield >94% validity + runtime safety.
   - **How to Improve**:
     - Add adapters for new domains: E.g., game AI (chess via chess library), healthcare protocols (biopython), or cybersecurity plans.
     - Integrate with PDDL-INSTRUCT: Feed STM alerts back into CoT refinement loops for self-correction, measuring combined uplift (e.g., 35% from CodeTrace + 66% from [3]).
     - Test: Pilot on 2-3 new applications, reporting metrics like steps-to-green or error reduction.

5. **Address Edge Cases and Robustness**:
   - **Why?** Perfect precision/recall is great, but null results in ablations (e.g., p=1.0 at low coverage) suggest over-reliance on synthetic data.
   - **How to Improve**: Add noise injection (e.g., random perturbations in traces) during calibration; evaluate on adversarial examples (e.g., near-valid plans from [3]'s failures).

These align with your patent on manifold tech—focus on embeddings/density for broader IP leverage.

#### Paper and Presentation Improvements
The whitepaper is research-oriented and reproducible, but mismatches in contents (e.g., Discussion on page 8 vs. listed as 9; CodeTrace on 7-8 vs. 8) and absent visuals (Figs 1-3, Tables 2-6 partially described) reduce polish. For Washington/funding (e.g., tying to AI safety), emphasize U.S. innovation.

1. **Structure and Clarity**:
   - Fix contents/page numbers (e.g., Discussion starts on 8, Limitations on 9). Add subsections for ablations (under 5.3).
   - Include/Describe Visuals: Embed or describe missing figures (e.g., Fig 1: bar charts for lead/coverage; Fig 2: sweep overlay; Fig 3: ANN curves). Tables 2-6 are crucial—ensure they're formatted cleanly (e.g., use LaTeX for alignment).

2. **Depth and Rigor**:
   - Expand Limitations: Quantify impacts (e.g., "n=300 limits CI95 to [0.82,0.92] in Mystery; scaling to 1,000 could halve variance").
   - Add Benchmarks: Compare p-values to other guardrails (e.g., from [1]/[2]); include runtime costs (e.g., calibration time).
   - Strengthen Claims: Temper "perfect twin recall" with caveats (synthetic bias); add error bars to leads (e.g., from Table 4's CI95).

3. **Impact and Funding Appeal**:
   - Add Broader Implications Section: Link to real-world (e.g., "STM could reduce infrastructure failures by 35% in U.S. logistics, aligning with EO 14277").
   - Enhance Reproducibility (Appendix A): Add GitHub link, Docker setup for scripts.
   - Polish Language: Minor edits for flow (e.g., Abstract: "We release... providing" → "We release... to provide"). Avoid repetitions (e.g., "null results" in 5.3).

Implementing these could make STM more fundable—e.g., demonstrate p<0.05 across domains for stronger safety claims. If needed, I can help draft revised sections or code for tests.
