Structural Context Co‑processor Case Study – Work Plan

Overview
The scrallex/score repository contains your QFH/QBSA-based “structural manifold” engine. You now want to turn this into a practical, licensable demonstration: a co‑processor that takes a raw data stream, builds a live manifold (context), and returns an enriched context object. This should be packaged into a demo that can run on your droplet and be compelling to investors. The “verify register” video describes a system that compares incoming data against a reference register to identify matches; your manifold does something analogous by comparing the current window’s signature against historical patterns. Both systems try to find “where have I seen this pattern before?” and use that to verify or enrich the current context.

Below is a complete, actionable outline to get from the current repo to a finished case study and demo.

1. Align Concepts: Scoring Repo vs. Verify Register Video

Video’s verify register: A table of known patterns; incoming data is hashed/checked against this “register” to verify authenticity or classify it quickly. It’s often used in streaming verification or deduplication systems.

Your scoring repo: Builds a manifold from live data via QFH/QBSA, computes coherence, stability, entropy and repetition signatures, and uses these to classify current windows and find structural twins. In effect, the manifold is a “register,” and its signatures are analogous to the verify register’s hashes.

Key similarity: Both maintain a reference sheet of patterns and use it to identify or classify new streams quickly.

Key difference: The scoring engine goes beyond hash matching; it tracks continuous metrics (coherence, entropy, rupture) and can produce lead‑time alerts and propose next strings. Your case study should explain how these extra metrics allow richer decisions than a simple verify register.

2. High‑Level Product Vision

Service: A containerized API server exposing /enrich (structural context co‑processor).

Input: Raw text/telemetry/log strings.

Process:

Bit‑encode the input into structural features (UP/ACCEL/RANGEEXP/ZPOS).

Compute QFH/QBSA metrics and repetition signature.

Compare against the stored manifold (the “register”) using ANN and signature postings.

Compute dilution metrics (Path Dilution, Signal Dilution, Semantic Dilution).

Surface high‑coherence foreground tokens and propose tangent themes.

Output: JSON containing the original context, top structural tokens with significance scores, tangent themes, dilution/confidence scores, and warnings on ambiguous tokens.

Demonstration: Provide a CLI and web UI for uploading text, getting enriched context, and visualizing the manifold (plots of coherence, stability, rupture over time).

3. Step‑by‑Step Implementation Plan
A. Repository Refactoring & Packaging

Create a single stm package inside the repo with clear modules:

adapters/: Preprocessing adapters (MMS, THEMIS, generic CSV).

core/: Existing kernel wrapper, bit‑encoding, QFH/QBSA logic.

manifold/: Data structures for signals, ANN index, signature postings.

router/: Percentile calibration, dilution metrics, retention policy.

api/: FastAPI routes (/enrich, /seen, /propose, /lead, /onsets, /dilution).

cli/: Command‑line entrypoints (stm ingest, stm report, stm stream, stm onsets, etc.).

Add setup/pyproject to make the package pip‑installable.

Write a Dockerfile that:

Installs Python, compile dependencies (pybind11, CDFlib), and the native C++ kernel.

Copies the package and configuration files.

Sets up CMD ["stm", "stream", "--config", "/config/default.yaml"].

B. Adapter & Preprocessing Enhancements

Finalize bit‑encoding for generic text and telemetry:

Map delta, acceleration, range expansion, and z‑position to bit flags per channel.

Implement an adapter to process CSV/HDF5/CDF into these bit tokens.

Write a generic text adapter that tokenizes by whitespace and phrase; produce structural tokens (e.g., n‑grams) and semantic tokens (original words).

C. Manifold & Router Improvements

Implement Dilution metrics:

Path Dilution from entropy of next‑signature distribution.

Signal Dilution from diversity of structural tokens in the foreground.

Semantic Dilution from mutual information between structural signatures and semantic tokens.

Add significance scoring:

Weighted combination of recency and popularity (connector centrality) for each token.

Implement retention policy:

Drop oldest structural tokens if they no longer improve PD/SD; keep novel ones longer.

D. API & CLI Endpoints

/enrich (POST):

Accept { context_string, config: { recency_weight, top_k_foreground, top_k_tangents } }.

Return structural summary (context certainty = 1‑PD, signal clarity = 1‑SD, semantic clarity = 1‑SeD), top foreground tokens, tangent themes, and warnings for high SeD.

/seen (POST): existing; return foreground & deferred windows given a trigger token.

/propose (POST): existing; propose new strings based on seeds and filters.

/lead (POST): return lead‑time bins given state and onset time.

/dilution (POST): return PD/SD/SeD for current window and list top candidate signatures/tokens.

CLI enhancements:

stm report generates the full case‑study report, including dilution plots.

stm onsets autolabel supports mission rules and writes onsets; optionally runs stm lead in one step.

E. Multi‑Mission Validation & Case‑Study

Run the pipeline on MMS (the baseline, already done).

Run on THEMIS (with new adapter) and produce a cross‑mission scorecard.

Run on a generic text corpus (e.g., doc files or open‑source code) to illustrate portability.

Write a technical note comparing results across missions: number of twins, lead‑time improvement, PD/SD trends.

F. Demo & Presentation Assets

Create “STM_OnePager.md” summarizing key metrics, results and investor talking points.

Update “Demo_Runbook.md”: live streaming and batch demonstration steps, referencing the new endpoints.

Finish “SUITE.md”: position STM alongside other SEP applications (text manifold, market signals).

Ensure all evidence (plots, tables, JSON) is packaged in docs/note/ and ready for export.

4. Licensing & Go‑to‑Market

Prepare the pilot SOW using docs/Pilot_SOW_Template.md: describe scope, success metrics (twins count, PD/SD improvement, lead‑time uplift), deliverables, timeline, and pricing.

Define licensing tiers: pilot (evaluation only), enterprise license (perpetual on‑prem deployment), OEM (royalty per unit).

Draft an investor summary that highlights the unique selling points (structural twins, percentile guardrail, early‑warning lead‑time, explainable tokens) and the potential market segments.

Chris’s outreach: Use the templates in docs/Outreach_Templates.md to contact relevant mission ops leads, predictive maintenance managers, and AI tool vendors. Provide the one‑pager and offer a pilot SOW.

5. Final Deliverables for the Coding Bot

To transform the scrallex/score repo into the described case study and product, supply your coding bot with:

This outline as the high‑level blueprint.

A list of todos (bullet‑point tasks), each clearly described with expected input/outputs.

A minimal API specification for /enrich, /dilution, /onsets/autolabel, and enhanced /stream usage.

Pointers to key files in the repository that need to be modified (e.g. src/sep_text_manifold/, docs/TOOL_QUICKSTART.md) and new files to be added (stm_adapters/nasa_themis.py, stm_stream/router.py, etc.).

Testing requirements: ensure the kernel litmus test remains, include unit tests for PD/SD/SeD, and integration tests for /enrich and streaming health.

By following the steps above, you will create a stand‑alone, data‑agnostic structural context co‑processor that demonstrates clear value using the existing scoring engine, while being packaged for licensing and pilot engagements.
