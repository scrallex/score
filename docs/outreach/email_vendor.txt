Subject: Drop-in structural coprocessor for code agents (early-warning + repair twins)

Hi <Name>,

We’ve wrapped our Structural Manifold (STM) as a coprocessor that sits alongside any coding agent. It watches each edit/test step, keeps the alert volume under a configurable guardrail, and surfaces “twin” patches pulled from past successful runs. In our three-task CodeTrace demo the STM version hit green in 30–40% fewer steps and raised the decisive alert before every fix.

Attaching the HTML comparison report plus the OpenAPI spec and lightweight Python client so your team can try it without wiring up new tooling.

Attachments:

- docs/api/openapi.yaml
- dist/sep_text_manifold-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

If you’d like a walkthrough or want to discuss a pilot, I’d love to grab 20 minutes this week. Let me know a couple time slots and I’ll send an invite.

Thanks,
<Your Name>
