# Integrating with SEP Engine

The Sep Text Manifold (STM) framework provides scaffolding for
performing bulk text analysis using the quantum–inspired metrics
developed in the SEP Engine.  It does not implement the core
algorithms itself.  Instead, you are expected to pull the
`QFH`/`QBSA` implementations and related manifold code from the existing
SEP repositories and expose them to Python via an FFI layer or a
compiled binary.

## Relevant files in the SEP repositories

The following files contain the core logic you will need to port or
wrap:

- **`src/core/qfh.h` / `src/core/qfh.cpp`** – Defines the
  `QFHOptions`, `QFHResult` and `QFHBasedProcessor` classes.  These
  classes implement the *Quantum Field Harmonics* algorithm which
  produces metrics including coherence, stability, entropy and
  rupture for a given bitstream.
- **`src/core/manifold_builder.cpp`** – Contains the logic to build a
  manifold from a stream of candles (or any ordered data).  It
  illustrates how to slide a window over a bitstream, call
  `QFHBasedProcessor::analyze` and produce a JSON object containing
  the metrics, repetition signature and hazard lambda for each
  window【739285426356909†L110-L169】.
- **`src/core/trajectory.h`** – Provides functions for computing
  forward projections of trajectories.  Although primarily used in
  trading applications, it can inspire how to extrapolate the path of
  a text signal.
- **`docs/task.md`** – Describes the conceptual shift towards
  treating the engine as an “Echo Finder” that detects repetition in
  data streams【991349507181826†L7-L21】.  This is particularly
  relevant when aggregating string occurrences by their repetition
  signature.
- **`docs/01_System_Concepts.md`** – Offers high‑level
  documentation on how the engine is structured and how metrics are
  combined.  Use it to guide your design decisions and ensure you are
  consistent with the SEP terminology.

## Suggested integration approach

1. **Build the SEP core as a shared library.**  Compile the C++
   components of the SEP Engine (e.g. the `qfh` and `manifold_builder`
   sources) into a shared library (`libsep.so`/`dll`).  Make sure
   exports include functions to create a processor instance and
   analyse a byte array.

2. **Create a thin Python wrapper.**  Use a tool such as
   [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/) or
   [ctypes/cffi](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) to
   expose the C++ functions to Python.  The wrapper should accept a
   `bytes` object and return a Python dict or a simple object with
   `coherence`, `stability`, `entropy`, `rupture` and `lambda_hazard`
   fields.

3. **Plug the wrapper into `encode.py`.**  The STM `encode.py` module
   defines the `encode_window` function which converts a window of
   bytes into a bitstream and then calls the quantum engine.  Modify
   this module to call into your C++ wrapper instead of the
   placeholder implementation.

4. **Validate with unit tests.**  Write tests in `tests/` that feed
   known input sequences into your wrapper and check that the
   resulting metrics match those produced by the original SEP
   executables.  Use the test patterns defined in the SEP repository
   (e.g. alternating bits, random noise, steady state) to ensure
   correctness.

5. **Optimise performance.**  For large corpora you may want to run
   the quantum engine on a GPU, as the SEP implementation does.  The
   same approach applies: wrap the GPU kernels in a shared library and
   call them from Python, or offload the heavy computation to a
   separate service accessible via RPC.
