You've correctly identified the absolute heart of the matter. The `nlohmann::json “type must be number”` warning from `manifold_generator` isn't just noise; it's a critical symptom. **If the manifold generator isn't pristine, nothing else matters.** All the sophisticated layers you've built—the allocator, the guards, the frontend—are running on corrupted fuel.

Let's strip this down to its essential core and build back up with ruthless simplicity.

### The Distilled Vision: The "Echo Finder"

Forget trading, forex, and even "signals" for a moment. The core technology you are building is an **Echo Finder**.

Its one and only job is to look at the very recent "rhythm" of a time series and answer a single question:

> **"Have I heard this exact rhythm before in the recent past? If so, how often?"**

This is what your `repeated_pattern_ok` function in `scripts/trading/patterns.py` is trying to do, but it's happening too late and on potentially flawed data. The core logic must live inside the C++ kernel, where the data is pure.

The "confused shit" you need to drop is anything that isn't directly serving this one purpose. The archived motif system was a perfect example of this—it tried to predict the *outcome* of a pattern, which is statistical guesswork. The Echo Finder is simpler and more powerful: it only detects **repetition**. Repetition itself is the signal.

### Redefining the Core Technology Stack (Simplified and Hardened)

Here is the blueprint for the one true version of your core tech.

#### 1. The Kernel: `manifold_builder` Becomes the "Rhythm Engine"

The `manifold_generator` and `manifold_builder` are the foundation. Their sole purpose is to convert a raw stream of candles into a clean, reliable stream of **Dynamic Fingerprints**.

**A. Fixing the Foundation (Immediate, Critical Task):**

*   **Problem:** The `nlohmann::json` warnings indicate that your candle parsing logic in `io_utils.cpp` (`load_candles_from_file`) or the data it's receiving is fragile. It's encountering non-numeric data where it expects numbers (e.g., `volume: "N/A"`).
*   **The Fix:** Harden `load_candles_from_file`.
    *   **In `io_utils.cpp`'s `parse_candle_obj`:** Wrap every `.get<double>()` call in a more robust parsing block. Check `j.at("...").is_number()` before calling `.get()`. If it's a string, attempt to convert it with `std::stod`. If any of these fail, **log the malformed line and skip the candle**. Do not emit a partial or zeroed-out candle. A missing candle is better than a corrupt one.
    *   **In `data_downloader_main.cpp`:** Add a validation step after fetching from OANDA. Loop through the candles and ensure all OHLCV values are numeric *before* writing them to your cache file or Valkey. This stops bad data from ever entering your system.

**B. Redefining the Output: The Canonical Dynamic Fingerprint**

The output of `manifold_builder.cpp` should not be a complex JSON with "patterns" and "signals." It should produce one thing: a time-series of Dynamic Fingerprints.

*   **Action:** Modify `buildManifold` in `manifold_builder.cpp`.
    *   The main loop should iterate through the bitstream using a sliding window.
    *   For each window, it runs the `QFHBasedProcessor::analyze` function.
    *   It emits a single, clean JSON object for that timestamp: The **Dynamic Fingerprint**.
*   **The New `sep:signal:{instrument}:{ts_ns}` Schema (The ONLY thing that matters):**
    ```json
    {
      "ts_ns": 1672531200123456789,
      "price": 1.08254,
      "metrics": {
        "coherence": 0.85,
        "stability": 0.92,
        "entropy": 0.15,
        "rupture": 0.01
      },
      "coeffs": {
        "lambda_hazard": 0.03,
        "sigma_eff_volatility": 0.02
      },
      "repetition": {  // <-- The NEW, CRITICAL field
        "signature": "c0.85_s0.92_e0.15", // A coarse, string-based key for the rhythm
        "count_1h": 5, // How many times this signature appeared in the last hour
        "first_seen_ms": 1672530840000
      }
    }
    ```

#### 2. The Repetition Logic: The "Echo Finder" Core

This is the new feature that must be built directly into the C++ `manifold_builder`. It's fast, efficient, and happens at the source.

*   **Implementation in `manifold_builder.cpp`:**
    1.  As you generate each fingerprint, create a coarse `signature` string from its rounded metrics (e.g., `c0.85_s0.92_e0.15`).
    2.  Maintain an in-memory `std::map<std::string, std::vector<uint64_t>>` that stores the timestamps for each signature seen so far *within the current run*.
    3.  For each new fingerprint, look up its signature in the map. Count how many previous timestamps fall within a recent window (e.g., the last hour).
    4.  Populate the `repetition` field in the output JSON.

*   **Why this is better:** The "echo finding" is now a native, first-class property of the signal itself. It's not an afterthought calculated in a slow Python script.

#### 3. The Decision Layer: `rolling_backtest_evaluator.py` Becomes the "Echo Gate"

The purpose of the evaluator is now radically simplified. It doesn't need complex hysteresis or cooldowns based on backtest performance. Its primary job is to act on the `repetition` data.

*   **The New Gating Logic:**
    *   **Hysteresis is replaced by Repetition.** An instrument becomes "eligible" when its most recent signal shows a `repetition.count_1h >= N` (e.g., `N=3`). It becomes ineligible when the count drops below `N`. This is a much more direct and intuitive measure of a stable, repeating pattern.
    *   **Cooldown is replaced by Hazard.** An instrument goes into cooldown if its `lambda_hazard` spikes above a threshold. This is a direct, forward-looking risk measure, superior to counting backtest "misses."

*   **Action:** Rewrite the core logic in `rolling_backtest_evaluator.py`.
    *   It no longer needs to run a full `backtest_engine` on every tick. This is computationally expensive and fragile.
    *   Instead, it fetches the latest `sep:signal:*` from Valkey.
    *   It reads the `repetition.count_1h` and `coeffs.lambda_hazard` fields.
    *   It applies the simple rules above to determine eligibility and cooldown.
    *   It writes the same `opt:rolling:gates_blob` that `allocator_lite` already understands.

### The Distilled, Functional Stack

This refined vision creates a clean, linear, and powerful data flow.

1.  **`data_downloader` (Hardened):** Ingests raw candles and *validates* them, ensuring only clean numbers enter the system.
2.  **`manifold_generator` (The Rhythm Engine):**
    *   Takes clean candles.
    *   Encodes the rhythm into a bitstream.
    *   Analyzes the bitstream to produce a time-series of **Dynamic Fingerprints**, each containing a `repetition` score.
    *   Writes these pure, enriched signals to Valkey.
3.  **`rolling_evaluator` (The Echo Gate):**
    *   Reads the latest enriched signal from Valkey.
    *   Uses the `repetition.count` and `lambda_hazard` to make a simple, fast, and robust eligibility decision.
    *   Writes the gate status to `opt:rolling:gates_blob`.
4.  **`allocator_lite` (Unchanged):**
    *   Reads the `gates_blob`.
    *   Reads the live metrics (`coherence`, etc.) for the now-eligible instruments.
    *   Performs its Top-K weighting as before.

### Your Path Forward from Here

1.  **Harden the C++ Parser (Top Priority):** Fix the `nlohmann::json` warnings by making your candle parsing in `io_utils.cpp` and `data_downloader_main.cpp` bulletproof. No bad data gets in. Period.
2.  **Implement the Repetition Counter:** Add the `repetition` logic directly inside `manifold_builder.cpp`. This is the core IP enhancement.
3.  **Simplify the Rolling Evaluator:** Rip out the `run_backtest` call. Replace it with the simpler "Echo Gate" logic that reads the new enriched signals from Valkey.
4.  **Clean House:** Once this is working, you can confidently delete the complex hysteresis and cooldown logic (`evaluate_and_gate_once`, `apply_cooldown_logic`), as they have been replaced by superior, direct metrics.

This approach focuses all your energy on making the core C++ engine perfect. It produces a signal that is so rich and self-descriptive that the downstream Python services become incredibly simple, robust, and easy to reason about. This is how you distill the best version of this technology.
