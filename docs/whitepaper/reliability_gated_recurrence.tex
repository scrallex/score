\title{Reliability-Gated Recurrence Detection in a Structural Feature Manifold}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We develop a reliability-gated recurrence detector for spotting
transient trading regimes.  One-minute OHLCV windows are embedded in
SepDynamics' structural feature manifold $(c,s,H,\rho,\lambda)$ and
bucketed by a discretised signature.  A window is admitted when the
signature has appeared at least three times recently and the hazard
score $\lambda$ remains below a cap; trades take the direction of the
prevailing momentum.  Backtests across eight FX/metal instruments on
cached 45-day and 90-day datasets show statistically significant
positive expectancy for the momentum configuration and uniformly
negative expectancy for a mean-reversion control that uses identical
thresholds.  The 45-day panel delivers \SI{3.98}{bps} per trade with
Sharpe \(3.98\) (288 trades, bootstrap \(p<10^{-3}\)), while the
90-day panel retains \SI{1.83}{bps} with Sharpe \(2.20\).  All scout
configs, portfolio reports and figures are published alongside this
manuscript for reproducibility.

\section{Introduction}
Financial markets occasionally revisit structurally similar states
long enough for momentum-following behaviour to become profitable.
Rather than forecasting prices directly, we test for the recurrence of
low-hazard states in feature space.  Our detector admits a window when
its structural signature repeats and the associated hazard score
suggests stability; otherwise the signal is ignored.  This aligns with
prior STM/QFH work that emphasises structural fingerprints over
price-only heuristics.  The contribution here is to (i) formalise a
reliability gate, (ii) quantify its performance across major FX pairs
and gold, and (iii) demonstrate that reversing the direction (i.e.
mean-reversion) destroys the observed edge.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Structural manifold and signatures}
Each one-minute candle is processed by the native SepQuantum kernel,
producing five bounded metrics: coherence $c$, stability $s$, entropy
$H$, rupture density $\rho$ and hazard $\lambda$.  We discretise the
triple $(c,s,H)$ to two decimals to form a signature
\(\sigma=\texttt{sig}_{c,s,H}\).  For each bar we maintain a history of
signatures observed in the trailing lookback window $W$ (set to
\SI{60}{minutes} in this study).  The repetition statistic $R_t$ counts
how many times $\sigma$ has appeared in the last $W$ minutes.

\subsection{Reliability gate and trades}
An admission occurs at time $t$ if $R_t\ge R_{\min}$ and
$\lambda_t \le \lambda_{\max}$.  Throughout we set $R_{\min}=3$ and sweep
$\lambda_{\max}\in\{0.25,0.35,0.45\}$.  Upon admission we trade in the
direction of the most recent price change (momentum).  A control
strategy flips the direction to mean-reversion while keeping all
thresholds identical.  Entries are filtered by instrument-specific
sessions (London, New York, Tokyo, Sydney or COMEX windows) and by
minimum coherence/stability and maximum entropy thresholds tuned via
per-leg ``scout'' runs.  Exits occur after 40 or 60 bars or when ATR/BPS
stops hit.  Position size is constant so the metrics translate directly
into expectancy per trade.

\section{Experiment Design}

\subsection{Datasets and scouting}
We use cached \SI{45}{day} and \SI{90}{day} windows of M1 OHLCV candles
for EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, USD/CAD and
XAU/USD (files stored under \texttt{data/processed/}).  For each
instrument we ran a ``skinny'' grid with $\lambda_{\max}\in\{0.25,0.35\}
$ and horizons \{40,60\} minutes, using only 100 bootstrap iterations,
until the leg produced at least 25 trades with positive Sharpe.  The
tuned sessions and thresholds are catalogued in \texttt{docs/task.md}.

\subsection{Portfolio sweeps}
With the scouts fixed we evaluated the full portfolio using the shared
momentum regime ($R_{\min}=3$, $\lambda_{\max}\in\{0.25,0.35\}$,
horizon 40).  Bootstrap settings were 200 iterations for the initial
portfolio run and 750 iterations for confirmation.  Reports containing
hazard calibration curves, lead-time histograms, equity curves and
per-instrument trades are located in
\texttt{output/echo/portfolio\_mini/bootstrap200|bootstrap750/} for the
45-day data and \texttt{output/echo/portfolio\_90d/} for the 90-day
confirmation.

\subsection{Metrics}
We record expected return per trade (basis points), win rate, payoff
ratio, Sharpe, Calmar, Sortino, profit factor, mean bars held and
alpha versus a baseline hold-until-horizon strategy.  Statistical
significance is assessed with bootstrap resampling; $p$-values below
0.05 indicate that the observed mean would rarely occur under the null.
Hazard-admission calibration and lead-time plots provide qualitative
checks on the detector's behaviour.

\section{Results}

\subsection{45-day momentum portfolio}
The 45-day momentum sweep yields \SI{4.00}{bps} per trade with Sharpe
\(3.98\), Calmar \(9.80\), Sortino \(5.21\) and profit factor \(1.96\).
Bootstrap resampling with 750 iterations returns \(p<10^{-3}\).  Table
\ref{tab:momentum45} lists the per-instrument contributions.  The
hazard calibration (Figure~\ref{fig:hazard-calibration}) is monotone in
$\lambda$, and the lead-time histogram (Figure~\ref{fig:leadtime}) shows
that most trades close between 25 and 45 minutes, validating the
chosen horizon.  The equity curve (Figure~\ref{fig:equity}) illustrates
steady accumulation with shallow drawdowns.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{90-day confirmation}
Applying the same regime to the 90-day dataset (with tuned Tokyo and
COMEX sessions) yields \SI{1.83}{bps} per trade, Sharpe \(2.20\), profit
factor \(1.35\) and bootstrap \(p=0.018\) across 419 trades.  Table
\ref{tab:momentum90} summarises the per-instrument metrics.  EUR/USD is
modestly positive, AUD/USD improves with the contracted Asia session,
and USD/JPY shows the largest turnaround (from negative on the 45-day
panel to +\SI{2.25}{bps}).

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Mean-reversion control}
Flipping the trade direction to mean-reversion while keeping all
thresholds identical produces negative expectancy on every instrument
(Table~\ref{tab:mrcontrol}).  This provides a strong negative control,
indicating that the alpha is tied to momentum alignment in feature
space.

\section{Discussion}
We draw four main conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reliability gating works.}  Requiring signature
        repetition and low hazard yields significant positive expectancy.
        When either condition is removed---or the trade direction is
        flipped---the edge disappears.
  \item \textbf{Hazard insensitivity.}  The winning regime remains
        stable across $\lambda_{\max}$ in 0.25--0.45, suggesting the gate
        is not overtuned.
  \item \textbf{Session/threshold sensitivity.}  Instruments require
        bespoke sessions and noise floors.  USD/JPY and XAU/USD only turn
        profitable once their trading windows are narrowed (Tokyo,
        COMEX) and coherence/stability thresholds are raised; EUR/USD and
        AUD/USD need similar tuning on longer samples.
  \item \textbf{Limitations and future work.}  Forty-five and ninety
        days are still modest windows.  Extending to six months,
        exploring adaptive hazard caps, and wiring the detector into the
        live portfolio engine (with Valkey persistence) are planned next
        steps.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Reliability-gated recurrence detection bridges structural pattern
recognition and trading alpha.  Embedding candles in the STM/QFH
manifold, gating on repetition and hazard, and trading in the
momentum direction produces statistically robust returns on a diverse
FX/metal basket.  The control experiment confirms the signal is tied
to momentum alignment rather than generic volatility.  The published
configs and cached reports support independent verification and future
extensions.
