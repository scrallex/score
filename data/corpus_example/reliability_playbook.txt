When onboarding a new corpus, start with a narrow subset that captures the intended retrieval style. Run the SRI membership benchmark to ensure high recall for known spans, then review the structural and semantic twin outputs for confusing near-miss content. Calibrate the admission gate only after the SBI metrics are stable; otherwise the thresholds will chase noisy spans rather than useful receipts.
