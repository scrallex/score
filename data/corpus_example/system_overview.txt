The Span Receipts Index pairs each span of text with provenance metadata so analysts can audit how a response was assembled. Each record includes a semantic embedding, structural fingerprints, and the originating corpus path. This example corpus models an operational handbook describing how the SRI pipeline is deployed inside a neutral environment. The material is intentionally generic so teams can adjust the narrative for their own domain.
