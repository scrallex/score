ARCHIVED — Obsolete Motif System

This document is kept for historical context. The live system no longer uses motif infrastructure or motif-derived alpha. All allocation and admission logic is driven by quantum metrics (coherence, stability, rupture, entropy), session gating, and strict spans. See `docs/01_System_Concepts.md` and `docs/02_Operations_Runbook.md`.

5.  Motif Intelligence System
    Overview
    The Motif Intelligence System is an advanced analytics framework that captures, analyzes, and presents trading pattern intelligence. It extends the SEP Engine's pattern detection capabilities by adding predictive outcome analysis and alpha generation insights.
    Motif Filters (Live Trading)
    • Quality thresholds (env‑tunable):

- OPT_MQ_P_MIN: minimum p_lcb1 for inclusion (default 0.55; raise to 0.70 for stricter).
- OPT_MQ_SAMPLES_MIN: minimum samples1 per motif (default 8).
  • Motif quality (MQ): average p_lcb1 over motifs passing filters (per instrument).
  • Trading admission: best motif must also satisfy |μ1| ≥ 0.5 bps (noise floor), within guard limits.

Top‑K Portfolio Selection
• Per instrument composite score:
S = 0.6·Opt + 0.25·Roots + 0.15·MQ

- Opt: backtest quality (Calmar+Sharpe rank)
- Roots: root‑open density over 96h from /api/autopilot/health
- MQ: as defined above
  • The optimizer selects ALLOC_TOP_K instruments by S; only these receive weights.

Research Track (to maximize NAV)
• Signal quality: test motif half‑life windows; Bayesian shrinkage of μ1; adaptive p_lcb1 per instrument.
• Portfolio: add per‑instrument VaR caps; portfolio ES targeting; Top‑K auto‑tuning by regime.
• Execution: latency/spread models; time‑of‑day filters; liquidity‑aware sizing caps.
• Robustness: White’s Reality Check across rolling windows; regime segmentation; walk‑forward out‑of‑sample verification.

Exporting History

Future Enhancements: Multi‑Motif Fan‑Out (Motif Sampler)
Instead of relying on a single best motif, consider sampling the top N qualifying motifs and blending/allocating entries across them up to each instrument cap. This approach reduces dependency on any single microstructure and may improve resiliency. Policy sketches:

- Filter: samples ≥ MIN_SAMPLES, p_lcb1 ≥ MIN_P_LCB1
- Rank: score = |mu1| × p_lcb1 × log(samples + 1)
- Allocate: proportional to score, with per‑motif min size and per‑instrument caps respected by RiskManager
