# STM Data Partnership Outreach (Template)

Hello <Name>,

I'm reaching out to explore a short data partnership with <Company>. We are
building the Structural Manifold Guardrail (STM), an early-warning coprocessor
for long-horizon planning systems. Our latest experiments highlight that
synthetic traces do not deliver statistically significant guardrail signals, so
we are collaborating with domain partners to calibrate the system on real
operational traces.

**What we need**
- Approximately 1,000 failed planning traces with matching successful runs
- State snapshots per step and any available failure annotations
- A two-week pilot window to ingest data and return a calibrated guardrail

**What you receive**
- Tailored STM calibration on your traces with permutation-significance audits
- Early-warning dashboards and twin-based intervention suggestions
- ROI report covering alert coverage, lead time, and avoided incidents

We handle data anonymisation, secure transfer, and deletion after the pilot. If
you're open to the collaboration, I can share the intake checklist and schedule
an onboarding call this week.
