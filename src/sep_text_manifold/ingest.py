"""
Ingestion utilities for the Sep Text Manifold project.

The functions in this module traverse a directory tree, read text
files and yield their contents.  They normalise all inputs to UTF‑8
strings and preserve file identifiers so that later stages can
associate computed metrics back to the original documents.

You may wish to extend this module to handle additional file types
(such as JSON or CSV) or to stream very large files in chunks
instead of reading them into memory.

def ingest_directory(directory: str, *, extensions: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None) -> Generator[Tuple[str, str, str], None, None]:
    """Recursively traverse *directory* and yield `(file_id, path, text)` tuples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    directory:
        Root directory to scan for files.
    extensions:
        Optional iterable of allowed file extensions (without the dot).  If
        provided, only files with one of these extensions (case
        insensitive) will be processed.  If ``None`` (the default) then
        all files are considered.

    Yields
    ------
    file_id : str
        A unique identifier derived from the file's relative path.  This
        can be used as a key in downstream tables.
    path : str
        The absolute path to the file on disk.
    text : str
        The file contents decoded as UTF‑8.  Any decoding errors are
        replaced with the Unicode replacement character ("\ufffd").
