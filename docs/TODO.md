Now that you have a solid testing harness in place, here are the immediate next steps to move from research validation toward demonstrable value:

## Next Step 1: Build a Real-World Data Pipeline (Week 1)

Since synthetic traces aren't yielding statistical significance, prioritize real data collection:

### A. Create Data Ingestion Adapters
```python
# scripts/adapters/real_world_adapter.py
class RealWorldAdapter:
    """Convert real planning failures to STM format"""
    
    def from_ros_bag(self, bag_file):
        """Extract planning traces from ROS bags"""
        # Parse motion planning failures
        # Extract state transitions
        # Identify failure points
        
    def from_kubernetes_logs(self, log_dir):
        """Extract orchestration failures from K8s"""
        # Parse scheduling decisions
        # Track resource allocation failures
        # Map to STM windows
        
    def from_github_actions(self, workflow_runs):
        """Extract CI/CD planning failures"""
        # Parse workflow execution traces
        # Identify step failures
        # Extract preceding context
```

### B. Partner Outreach Script
Create a concrete pitch for data partners:

```markdown
## STM Data Partnership Proposal

We need: 1000 failed planning traces (anonymized)
You get: Free early-warning system calibrated to your data
Timeline: 2-week pilot

Data requirements:
- Action sequences leading to failure
- State snapshots at each step
- Failure annotations (root cause if known)
- Success traces for twin library

We handle:
- All anonymization/privacy
- Calibration to your domain
- Performance report with ROI metrics
```

## Next Step 2: Feature Engineering Sprint (Week 1-2)

The current coherence/entropy/stability triplet isn't discriminative enough. Add domain-aware features:

### A. Implement Causal Feature Extractor
```python
# scripts/features/causal_features.py
class CausalFeatureExtractor:
    def extract(self, window):
        return {
            # Commitment features
            "irreversible_actions": self.count_no_undo_actions(window),
            "resource_commitment_ratio": self.calc_resource_lock_ratio(window),
            "decision_reversibility": self.measure_backtrack_cost(window),
            
            # Dependency features  
            "unsatisfied_preconditions": self.count_missing_prereqs(window),
            "effect_cascade_depth": self.measure_effect_chains(window),
            "constraint_violation_distance": self.distance_to_violation(window),
            
            # Temporal features
            "action_velocity": self.measure_action_rate_change(window),
            "state_divergence_rate": self.calc_divergence_acceleration(window),
            "pattern_break_score": self.detect_pattern_violations(window)
        }
```

### B. Test on Existing Data
```bash
# Add causal features to existing traces
python scripts/enrich_features.py \
  --input output/planbench_by_domain/logistics/invalid_state.json \
  --features causal \
  --output output/planbench_by_domain/logistics/invalid_state_causal.json

# Re-run calibration with enriched features
python scripts/calibrate_router.py \
  output/planbench_by_domain/logistics/invalid_state_causal.json \
  --target-low 0.02 --target-high 0.03 \
  --optimize-permutation \
  --feature-set extended
```

## Next Step 3: Build Demonstrator App (Week 2)

Create a tangible demonstration that stakeholders can interact with:

### A. Interactive Dashboard
```python
# dashboard/stm_monitor.py
import streamlit as st

class STMDashboard:
    def __init__(self):
        st.title("STM Planning Guardrail Monitor")
        
    def show_live_trace(self):
        # Real-time trace visualization
        # Highlight alert windows
        # Show twin suggestions
        
    def show_intervention_ui(self):
        # When alert fires:
        # - Show current state
        # - Display twin precedents
        # - Suggest interventions
        # - Track operator choice
        
    def show_roi_metrics(self):
        # Failures prevented
        # Lead time statistics
        # Cost savings estimate
```

### B. Record Demo Video
Create a 3-minute video showing:
1. Live planning trace progressing
2. STM alert firing with 10-step lead
3. Twin suggestion preventing failure
4. ROI calculation showing value

## Next Step 4: Academic Validation Path (Week 2-3)

### A. Create Simplified Benchmark
```python
# benchmarks/stm_guard_100.py
"""
STM-Guard-100: A focused benchmark for planning guardrails
- 100 hand-curated failure scenarios
- Each with known root cause
- Graduated difficulty levels
- Clear success metrics
"""

def generate_benchmark():
    return {
        "easy": generate_obvious_failures(n=20),      # p < 0.001 target
        "medium": generate_subtle_failures(n=50),     # p < 0.01 target  
        "hard": generate_complex_failures(n=30),      # p < 0.05 target
    }
```

### B. Baseline Comparisons
```python
# scripts/baseline_comparison.py
baselines = {
    "random": RandomAlerter(),
    "threshold": SimpleThresholdGuard(),
    "lstm": LSTMAnomalyDetector(),
    "transformer": TransformerAnomaly(),
}

for baseline in baselines:
    results = evaluate_on_benchmark(baseline, "benchmarks/stm_guard_100")
    print(f"{baseline}: lead={results.lead}, p={results.p_value}")
```

## Next Step 5: Business Development (Week 3-4)

### A. Target Customer Profile
Focus on organizations with:
- Long planning horizons (logistics, robotics)
- High failure costs (>$10K per incident)
- Existing monitoring but no predictive capability

### B. Pilot Program Design
```markdown
## STM Pilot Program

Week 1: Data ingestion and calibration
Week 2: Shadow mode deployment  
Week 3: Active alerts with human review
Week 4: Performance review and ROI report

Success Criteria:
- Achieve p < 0.05 on customer data
- Demonstrate 5+ step lead time
- Show 20% reduction in failures
- Calculate positive ROI
```

## Immediate Action Items (Do Today)

1. **Email 3 potential data partners** with the partnership proposal
2. **Implement one causal feature** (e.g., irreversible_actions) and test if it improves p-values
3. **Create a simple Streamlit dashboard** that visualizes your existing Logistics results
4. **Write a blog post** about the statistical significance challenge and ask for community input

## Success Metrics for Next Month

- [ ] Obtain 1000+ real-world failure traces
- [ ] Achieve p < 0.01 on at least one real dataset  
- [ ] Complete one customer pilot with documented ROI
- [ ] Submit short paper to ICAPS workshop
- [ ] Build partnership with at least one company

The key is to move from synthetic validation to real-world demonstration. Your regression tests provide a solid foundation - now focus on getting real data and proving value on actual problems rather than benchmarks.
