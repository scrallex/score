# O-Space Reliability Meets Transformer Attention

## 1. Introduction: Problem Framing
- The Transformer gate now drives `scripts/reality_filter_eval.py`; on whitepaper_demo it currently admits no spans (macro-F1 0.115, hallucination rate 1.0; `results/eval/whitepaper_demo_transformer/eval_summary.json`), reinforcing that the pack lacks supporting citations.
- Docs_demo shows a modest lift (macro-F1 0.193 vs. 0.115 heuristic) yet still hallucinates 95.8% of answers (`results/eval/docs_demo_transformer/eval_summary.json`), underscoring the need for denser evidence rather than more aggressive gating.
- Threshold sweeps now source calibrated admit/margin defaults from `results/analysis/calibration_summary.json`, but evidence scarcity still collapses whitepaper_demo to zero coverage even when the Transformer gate is active.
- URI hits continue to bypass structural checks: zero-margin links emit ``SUPPORTED`` in the baseline answers while the repaired answers refuse to admit, highlighting the brittleness of the previous token-support override.
- The goal is to replace the rule set with an attention-backed admit policy that learns when structural evidence in O-space is present, so we can gate both generated answers and market spans on measurable support.

| Pack | Macro-F1 (heuristic) | Macro-F1 (Transformer) | Hallucination (heuristic) | Hallucination (Transformer) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FEVER dev | 0.162 | 0.166 | 1.000 | 0.872 |
| docs_demo | 0.115 | 0.193 | 1.000 | 0.958 |
| whitepaper_demo | 0.356 | 0.115 | 0.167 | 1.000 |

## 2. Primer on Transformer Attention
- **Scaled dot-product attention (Sec. 3.2.1, Fig. 2, Vaswani et al., 2017):** Queries attend to keys via sqrt(d_k) scaling and softmax weighting, mirroring our O-space lookups where a span retrieves manifold neighbours based on structural similarity.
- **Multi-head diversity (Sec. 3.2.2):** Splitting into 4-8 heads lets each projection specialise (support, contradiction, recurrence, noise suppression) and replaces the manually maintained reliability bands in the current filter.
- **Long-range connectivity (Table 1):** Self-attention delivers $O(1)$ maximum path length versus the $O(n)$ latency of the recurrent twin-repair loop, which is essential for rupture-spanning evidence.
- **Position and phase (Sec. 3.5):** Standard sinusoidal encodings preserve generalisation; we add prime/phase channels so rhythmic structure enters the network without losing extrapolation ability.
- **Cross-attention for evidence gating (Sec. 3.2.3):** Decoder-to-encoder attention maps directly onto "query span attends to manifold memory," foreshadowing a cross-attention block that grounds admit decisions in stored citations or price windows.

## 3. Recap of the Manifold / QFH / QBSA Framework
- Every window carries coherence, stability, entropy, rupture density, and hazard lambda plus derived patternability and semantic metrics; these live in the ORJSON manifolds emitted by the QFH/QBSA stack.
- Sliding-window ingestion feeds `sep_text_manifold.encode_window`, repetition counts, and hazard thresholds into manifests that drive both the heuristic guardrail and the new transformer features.
- The twin-repair loop still runs end to end but exhibits failure modes documented in recent runs: latched hallucination flags and unchecked URI overrides inside `scripts/reality_filter_eval.py`.
- Prior whitepapers (`docs/whitepaper/QFH_Manifold_Foundation.tex`, `docs/whitepaper/reliability_gated_recurrence_polished.tex`) capture empirical support for the manifold, giving us a foundation to cite in the new draft.

## 4. Proposed Model Architecture (O-Space Transformer)
1. **Backbone:** Lightweight Transformer (2-4 layers, 4-8 heads) with causal self-attention over span/candle sequences, tuned via `sep_text_manifold.attn_ospace.OspaceTransformer`.
2. **Evidence memory + cross-attention:** Truth-pack strings or price windows flow through the `EvidenceEncoder`, yielding the key/value cache consumed by the cross-attention block.
3. **Reliability head:** A two-branch MLP outputs admit probability and support margin, trained on repaired labels pulled from evaluation artefacts.
4. **Phase/prime encoding:** Phase tensors align with prime ticks and rhythm metrics, concatenated with sinusoidal encodings so the model sees O-space beat structure.
5. **Structured sparsity:** Local-plus-rupture attention masks keep throughput at the >=1k rps target while retaining global access to hazard spikes.
6. **Calibration hooks:** Admit/margin thresholds and optional temperature scaling are baked into `scripts/train_reliability_attn.py` so the model emits calibrated probabilities.

## 5. Experimental Programme
- **E0 - Dataset bootstrapping:** FEVER ([fever.ai](https://fever.ai/)), SciFact ([researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343901998_SciFact)), and HoVer ([arxiv.org/abs/2011.00685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00685)) converters now emit STM-compatible `eval_detail.jsonl` files with structural metrics (`scripts/convert_*_to_eval.py`). Coverage audits still show whitepaper_demo lacks evidence density, explaining the zero-coverage sweep.
- **E1 - Final-answer scoring:** GPU retrains on FEVER reach test F1 0.756 with calibrated thresholds (checkpoint `models/reliability_fever_attn_full.pt`); whitepaper_demo remains unchanged because the reliability head is not yet wired into the admission path.
- **E2 - Margin/overlap calibration:** Calibration sweeps and temperature scaling reduce SciFact ECE from 0.207 to 0.075 (`results/analysis/scifact_temperature_finetune.json`), but we still need to propagate the calibrated thresholds into `reality_filter_eval.py`.
- **E3 - Phase encoding ablation:** Dropping phase channels cuts FEVER test F1 from 0.756 to 0.690; SciFact remains fragile without them, so the whitepaper will position phase information as a key ablation result.
- **E4 - Head specialisation analysis:** Multi-hop fine-tuning on HoVer (2 epochs, RTX 3080 Ti) lifts validation F1 to 0.727 and test F1 to 0.662 at calibrated thresholds 0.2 / 0.0 (`results/experiments/hover_multi_hop_trial.json`). The refreshed attention summary (`docs/figures/hover_attention_multi_hop.png`) shows the Transformer concentrating weights on secondary-hop evidence; mean attention entropy drops to 1.82 with 90th percentile max weight 0.20 (`results/experiments/hover_multi_hop_eval_summary.json`).
- **E5 - Sparsity sweep:** Structured masking over the multi-hop checkpoint (`results/experiments/hover_multi_hop_sparsity.json`) keeps admit precision/recall at 1.0 while throughput ranges 179-184 records/sec as we vary local window {32, 64} and rupture tokens {4, 8}, giving us concrete throughput vs. context-size trade-offs.

## 6. Integration Plan
- **Model implementation:** `src/sep_text_manifold/attn_ospace.py` hosts the Transformer backbone, phase fusion, cross-attention, and reliability head.
- **Training harness:** `scripts/train_reliability_attn.py` ingests eval details, trains with calibration sweeps, and logs admit precision/recall, Brier score, ECE, and attention entropy.
- **Dataset ingestion:** `scripts/convert_fever_to_eval.py`, `scripts/convert_scifact_to_eval.py`, and `scripts/convert_hover_to_eval.py` hydrate corpora into STM evaluation artefacts with structural metrics and citations.
- **Service swap:** `scripts/reality_filter_eval.py` now defaults to the Transformer gate (with `--disable-reliability` as an escape hatch); the outstanding work is rerunning FEVER/SciFact/HoVer packs on GPU hardware and wiring the refreshed metrics into the demos.
- **Logging & reports:** Attention artefacts are now timestamped (`results/eval/<pack>_transformer/attention_<timestamp>/`) and indexed in `results/attention_logs.txt`. After aggregation we collapse the per-claim heatmaps into mean-intensity figures (e.g. `docs/figures/attention_docs_demo_transformer_*.png`), then prune the raw PNGs so the repo stays lightweight. We still publish aggregate figures (`docs/figures/attention_summary.png`, `docs/figures/hover_attention_multi_hop.png`), while `scripts/plot_reliability_results.py` regenerates the comparison plots and writes the Markdown metrics table alongside `results/experiments/hover_multi_hop_eval_summary.json` for reproducibility.
- **CI guardrails:** `.github/workflows/attn-tests.yml` trains a 1-epoch demo model and ensures evaluator parity; next step is wiring the calibration comparison when the reality filter consumes the new admit scores.

## 7. Discussion and Open Questions
The CUDA reruns confirm the two headline hypotheses. First, the attention head is
decisive when sufficient evidence exists: FEVER reliability ablations still show
phase removal dropping test F1 from 0.756 to 0.690, and the feature-dimension
and MLP baselines trail the full Transformer despite sharing identical metrics.
Second, the gate is unforgiving when the pack lacks citations. On
`docs_demo` and `whitepaper_demo` the transformer declines almost every span,
leaving hallucination rates near 1.0 because the underlying truth packs do not
yet contain the requisite evidence sentences. FEVER exhibits the same pattern:
with the calibrated thresholds the gate emits nothing, making it clear that we
must enrich the pack (or relax the structural thresholds) before we can claim a
precision gain in the paper.

SciFact remains the weakest transfer story. Even with temperature scaling the
finetuned reliability head tops out at test F1 â‰ˆ0.52, and the absence of a
SciFact truth pack prevented a full reality-filter evaluation. We should either
add a lightweight SciFact manifold (claims + source abstracts) or explicitly
position SciFact as a negative result that motivates domain-adaptive fine
tuning. HoVer mirrors this: the FEVER-trained head struggles without additional
multi-hop evidence, although the curriculum run hints that attention can recover
once the secondary hops are present.

- **Evidence memory:** Should we pre-compute embeddings, learn them jointly, or keep a hybrid cache that fuses manifold metrics with token embeddings?
- **Attention sparsity vs coverage:** What balance between local restricted attention and global rupture tokens preserves admit precision while meeting the >=1k rps SLO?
- **API exposure:** Do we surface the reliability head as a standalone endpoint so planning/execution agents can query admit probabilities directly?
- **Auditability:** How do we version and store per-head attention maps so future audits can reconstruct decisions across FEVER, SciFact, HoVer, and internal packs?
- **Immediate actions:**
  1. Build or ingest SciFact and HoVer truth packs so the transformer gate can be profiled end-to-end (or document the omission as a limitation).
  2. Back off the FEVER pack thresholds or enrich the evidence so the transformer admits non-trivial spans, then re-run the CUDA evaluation to log the improvement.
  3. Integrate `scripts/aggregate_attention_snapshots.py` + `scripts/plot_reliability_results.py` into CI to guarantee that every run logs the aggregated attention charts alongside the metrics table.

## 8. Attention Map Retention
Every evaluation run writes its raw attention PNGs to
`results/eval/<pack>_transformer/attention_<timestamp>/`. The aggregator script
(`scripts/aggregate_attention_snapshots.py`) collapses those hundreds of tiles
into a single mean-intensity chart per run and appends the aggregate path to
`results/attention_logs.txt`. The companion plotting script regenerates the
publication figures from the reliability summaries; together they ensure that a
reviewer can reproduce the visuals by running:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python scripts/reality_filter_eval.py ...
python scripts/aggregate_attention_snapshots.py
python scripts/plot_reliability_results.py --device cuda
```

The appendix will reference both scripts so future readers know how to recover
the raw attention grids if they need to audit a specific claim.

## 9. Conclusions and Limitations
Transformer gating improves reliability metrics only when the evidence manifold
is rich enough to support admissions. Phase channels remain criticalâ€”the FEVER
ablation confirms a ~0.07 F1 drop without themâ€”while HoVer requires explicit
multi-hop retrieval to surface supporting spans. Sparse packs (docs_demo,
whitepaper_demo) and missing manifolds (SciFact, HoVer) are the dominant
failure modes: the gate simply declines everything. Future work should focus on
ingesting those corpora, relaxing structural thresholds once real citations are
available, and exploring domain-adaptive fine-tuning so SciFact and HoVer
benefit from the same calibrated gate that helps FEVER.
