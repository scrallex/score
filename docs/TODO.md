Here’s how to take what you have now (PlanBench + CodeTrace demos, API, Docker, client lib, sensitivity appendix, outreach drafts) and position it for **documentation → outreach → funding**:

---

## 1. Package a Whitepaper (STM vs MIT baseline)

**Sections you already have (in `pddl_experiment.md` and `MMS_Structural_Precursors.md`):**

* Purpose & pipeline.
* Dataset construction (generate → corrupt → VAL → STM).
* Metrics (accuracy, lead, coverage, twins, dilution).
* Results tables (3×100 tasks).
* Guardrail and τ-sweep appendices.

**What to add:**

* **Abstract & intro**: position STM as *PlanBench++* (beyond binary validity).
* **Comparison section**: paste in the drafted paragraph contrasting MIT vs STM (lead 5–16 steps, 10–16 % coverage, twin repair, p-values).
* **CodeTrace section**: add your new demo evidence (report.html, twin snippet, success-rate improvement vs baseline).
* **Integration diagram**: show STM as a co-processor in a coding agent loop (LLM→STM→repair).
* **Conclusion**: STM transforms verification into an *early-warning + repair feedback loop*.

Deliverable = a single PDF whitepaper (combine PlanBench + CodeTrace demos). This is what you send to MIT and to investors.

## 2. Define the Product (what people buy)

**Name**: SEP Structural Manifold (STM) Co-processor.
**Form**: Docker container + Python client.
**API**: `/stm/enrich`, `/stm/dilution`, `/stm/seen`, `/stm/propose`, `/stm/lead`.
**Adapters**: PDDLTrace, CodeTrace (done), more domain adapters possible.
**Evidence**: PlanBench results (lead/twin), CodeTrace demo (green builds faster).

**Licensable SKU:**

* **Pilot (8 weeks):** \$50–150k; includes STM container, client lib, adapter help, demo results.
* **Enterprise license:** \$100–300k/yr; unlimited internal use, updates, SLA.
* **OEM (vendors):** annual royalty or per-seat licensing for integration into codebots/agent frameworks.

**Renewal drivers**: new adapters, tuned guardrails, enterprise support, scaling to more projects.

## 3. Who to Approach

**Academic/research:**

* MIT PlanBench authors — co-author or at least feedback.
* Robotics/autonomy labs (Stanford, CMU, Berkeley).

**Commercial (first customers):**

* **Code tooling startups**: Kilocode, Cursor, Sourcegraph Cody, Tabnine, Codeium.
* **Platform teams**: large enterprises experimenting with internal agents.
* **Cloud providers**: AWS Bedrock, Azure, Anthropic eval teams (agent safety).

## 4. What Investors Need to See

* **Undeniable evidence:**

  * PlanBench: 100 % plan accuracy + **lead 5–16 steps** + guardrail coverage + twin repair with p-values.
  * CodeTrace: baseline vs STM demo; STM = faster green builds, fewer loops.
* **Market demand:**

  * Code agents are exploding; STM = “safety net + booster.”
* **Path to revenue:** pilot → enterprise → OEM.
* **Defensibility:** STM is based on your patented manifold mapping.

## 5. Immediate Next Steps

1. **Produce whitepaper PDF**: merge `pddl_experiment.md` + `MMS_Structural_Precursors.md` + `demo/coding/output/report.html` into a narrative.
2. **Insert diagrams**: STM in a planning loop, STM in a coding agent loop.
3. **Polish evidence**: drop in 2 plots from PlanBench (foreground clumps), 1 screenshot from CodeTrace (`/stm/seen` alert).
4. **Finalize outreach package**:

   * Email to MIT with the whitepaper PDF + CSVs.
   * Email to vendor with CodeTrace report.html + Docker pull instructions.
5. **Funding deck slide inserts**:

   * “PlanBench++”: lead + twin.
   * “CodeTrace uplift”: baseline vs STM metrics.
   * “Architecture”: API endpoints & adapters.
   * “Commercial model”: Pilot → Enterprise → OEM.
